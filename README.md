## Inspiration
The inspiration behind creating the Healthy Wealthy app stemmed from the frustration of waiting in clinics for extended periods to access health professionals and the high costs associated with their services. Recognizing the importance of prioritizing health and not ignoring any health concerns, the need for a solution became evident. The app aims to address these challenges and be a go-to resource for mental health support, healthy eating guidance, exercise advice, and instant access to medical perspectives. By harnessing the power of AI, the app empowers individuals to take charge of their health anywhere, anytime, making health truly wealth.

## What it does
Healthy Wealthy is an AI-powered app utilizing MongoDB Atlas, Computer Vision (CV) and Language Model (LLM) to empower users with health and wellness insights. It detects health issues in X-ray scans, guides healthy eating, plans diets, suggests wholesome shopping options, provides emotion-based mental health support, acts as an AI exercise coach, tracks exercise moves, corrects pose estimation, checks for proper gestures, generates summaries of medical reports, and much more.

Empowering individuals with accessible, AI-driven healthcare support and informed decision-making.
- Disease Detection🔍 = IT uses MongoDB Atlas to get the personalised info about the person .Here patients can upload X-ray scan images to check for diseases like pneumonia, using AI-powered algorithms to aid in accurate diagnosis and timely medical assistance. 
- Daily Diet Planner🥗📅 = uses MongoDB Atlas to get the personalised info about the person . Here users can input their diet preferences, including calorie goals and cuisine choices, to receive a comprehensive daily meal plan for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Additionally, they can seek healthy snack suggestions to curb cravings effectively.

## How we built it
This project uses MongoDB Atlas, AI, CV, LLM and Streamlit 
- MOngoDB Atlas to get the users info
- Streamlit - it is used to build the web app.
- CV = it is used for image processing and real time video processing
-  llm = it is used to chat with patients, provide aditional info, give summary and a lot more.

## Challenges we ran into
- Since it was my first time working with MongoDB Atlas learning the queries and doing the project simultaneously was challenging
- It was challenging to integrate computer vision with llm. Since I am in my initial stage of learning streamlit , making the project was challenging. To build an app for patients in an interactive manner was challenging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Use MOngoDB Atlas to get the personalised info of the users
- Detect the diseases by processing the xray scans 
- provide nutritional guidance to patients 
- AI Doctor for all time support to patients.
- Use AI for the good of all
- Make attempt to enable health care be accessible to all
## What we learned
 - I learnt to use MOngoDB Atlas
- I learnt to use NoSQL in AI projects
- I learnt how to use streamlit learnt to use LLM in my projects Integrate CV with LLM

## What's next for Healthy Wealthy
- As of now it is able to detect only diseases like pneumonia, I want to make sure the model can detect a lot more diseases like tumors and more.
- I want to include Ai exercise coach. This coach should be able to check if the exercise poses are correct. Provide proper exercise schedules for users.
